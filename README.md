a repository of python scripts that I came up with

## "RomanNumerals" Script
The "RomanNumerals" script will convert 1 - 4 digit numerals. Doesn't "really" support numbers beyond 4000 because the 5,000 roman
numeral and higher use special characters that I haven't really coded for yet. I've got lower case versions of the special characters
represented.
